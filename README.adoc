A minimal {cookiecutter-url}[cookiecutter] template for Python projects using {setuptools}[setuptools]. It closely follows the recomendations in the _official_ {python-packaging-guide}[packaging guide] and {python-packaging-tutorial}[tutorial]. See below  [tutorial(See below for more details; also the {pypa-packging-tutorial}[_official tutorial_]

For a more complex (but powerful) alternative, consider [https://github.com/cjolowicz/cookiecutter-hypermodern-python[cookiecutter-hypermodern-python], upon which this is loosely based.
